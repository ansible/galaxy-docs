License Features
=================================

.. index:: 
   single: license; features

.. note::

    |at| version 2.2 introduced a separation of features for Basic versus Enterprise or Premium licenses. 

The following list of features are available for all new Enterprise or Premium license users:

- Custom rebranding for login (*added in Ansible Tower 2.4.0*)
- SAML and RADIUS Authentication Support (*added in Ansible Tower 2.4.0*)
- Multi-Organization Support
- Activity Streams
- Surveys
- LDAP Support
- High Availability
- System Tracking  (*added in Ansible Tower 2.2.0*)

Users with an existing license (Basic, Enterprise, or Premium) can access all of the features included with the |at| release at the time of their purchase. For example, users with an existing Basic license issued before |at| 2.2 was released would have access to all the above features, except for System Tracking--which was introduced in |at| 2.2.

Enterprise license users with versions of |at| prior to 2.2 must import a new license file to enable System Tracking.
